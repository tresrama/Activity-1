  <p>
    Cheesy Mashed Potatoes are fluffy and creamy and loaded with 3 kinds of
    cheese. Totally customizable and simple to prepare, this easy baked mashed
    potatoes side dish is great for making ahead during the holidays. Mashed
    potatoes in any form, be it slow cooker, instant pot or just regular stove
    top are among my top three favorite foods. I could eat a bowl of piping hot,
    creamy, buttery mashed potatoes for breakfast, lunch and dinner and not get
    tired of them. My favorite way to make mashed potatoes though, is to bake
    them. Baked mashed potatoes have that same super fluffy and creamy texture,
    but they also have golden, crunchy bits on top which is a perfect contrast.
    My cheesy mashed potatoes are mixed, then spread into a pan and refrigerated
    until dinnertime. You can also bake them right away, or don’t bake them at
    all if you’re in a hurry.

  <h2>How to Make Cheesy Mashed Potatoes</h2>
  <p>
    Mashed potatoes were one of the very first things I learned how to make. I
    mean, it’s pretty simple, right? Peel, chop, boil, mash. While I do love
    plain and simple with cream and butter, something magical happens when you
    add three kinds of cheese and sour cream.

    1. First things first, grab a large pot. For 4 pounds of potatoes, I use a
    5-quart dutch oven. Fill the pot with about 2-3 inches of water. It won’t
    seem like a lot but the potatoes displace a lot of the water and your pot
    will be full. You can always add or remove water once you’ve added the
    potatoes. Add a generous amount of salt to season the potatoes as they cook.
  </p>
  <p>
    2. While the water is coming to a boil, rinse, peel and dice the potatoes
    into evenly sized chunks. Try to get the chunks close in size because that
    will help them to cook more evenly. Place the potatoes into the boiling
    water gently to avoid splashing.
  </p>
  <p>
    3. Keep the heat at medium to medium-low so it keeps bubbling and cook the
    potatoes for about 20 minutes. Keep the lid on the pot, but not quite all
    the way. This lets the steam escape but still keeps the heat in. Otherwise
    the starchy water tends to boil over leaving a big mess on your stove. When
    the potatoes are fork tender (they break apart easily when pierced with a
    fork) drain them in a large colander and place them pack in the pot.
  </p>
  <p>
    4. Now the fun begins – grab a masher and start mashing! Season the potatoes
    with salt and add some softened butter and mash away, careful not to take it
    too far and risk them becoming gummy. I typically will leave my potatoes a
    tad lumpy because I like the texture. You can beat them with a hand mixer if
    you want them super creamy, just use caution not to over-mix. Set aside
    while you prepare the cheese mixture.
  </p>
  <p>
    5. You can’t have cheesy mashed potatoes without cheese! Beat some softened
    cream cheese until smooth, then stir in Parmesan and white cheddar cheese
    (feel free to use regular cheddar if that’s what you have) .Stir in sour
    cream, minced garlic and black pepper. Taste and add more salt if you like.
  </p>
  <p>
    6. Stir the cheese gently into the mashed potatoes. At this point you can
    opt to serve them right away or spread them into a pan for baking. If making
    baked mashed potatoes, you’ll want to reserve some cheese for topping. Cover
    with foil and refrigerate until you’re ready to bake, or up to 24 hours.
    Bake mashed potatoes for about 45 minutes, removing the foil about halfway
    through to brown the top.
